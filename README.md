# Magic of Compounding Tool

This is a React-based investment calculator project that allows users to estimate the growth of their investments based on the following input parameters:

- **Initial Investment**: The starting amount of money invested.
- **Annual Investment**: The additional investment made every year.
- **Expected Return**: The annual percentage return expected from the investment.
- **Duration (Months)**: The total duration of the investment in months.

The application includes a simple interface with input fields for these parameters and a "Calculate" button to compute the projected investment value.

## Features

- **Dynamic Calculations**: Updates the projected investment value based on user input.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Reusable Components**: Built with modular and reusable React components.
